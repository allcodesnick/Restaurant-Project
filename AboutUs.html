      <tr><td align= "center">Established in St. Joseph, MO, in 1993, La Mesa Mexican Restaurant
           is the Midwest's favorite Mexican restaurant. Over the years, we've grown to operate
            eight restaurants across Omaha, NE, Council Bluffs, IA, Lansing, KS, and St. Joseph.
             Owner Frank Onate and general manager Jose Salazar have both been working in the restaurant
              industry for more than 25 years. Their experience in all aspects of restaurant operation,
               from creating quality meals to managing multiple locations, is what makes La Mesa the best Mexican restaurant around!</td></tr>
      <tr><td align= "center">Quality Service</td></tr><br>
      <tr><td align= "center">At La Mesa Mexican Restaurant, we want every customer to
           leave with an excellent dining experience. We work hard to ensure every
            authentic Mexican dish and cocktail we serve is properly prepared with
             fresh ingredients. We also strive to provide great customer service, whether
              that's getting your food out in a timely manner or addressing any concerns
               you may have. When quality food meets quality service, we know we've done our job right.</td></tr>
